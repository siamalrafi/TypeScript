Typescript is now a very popular and powerful programming for large scale applications. In this article, I will try to explain some of the basic knowledge of typescript.

Data types of Typescript --

In TypeScript, primitive types are data types that are not objects and do not have any methods. They are considered basic building blocks of the language and are used to define variables, function parameters, and return types.

TypeScript has the following primitive types

number: represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
string: represents textual data, including strings of characters.
boolean: represents a logical value, which can be either true or false.
null: represents an intentional absence of any object value.
undefined: represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
bigint: represents integers with arbitrary precision, using the n suffix to denote a bigint literal. It is only available in ECMAScript 2020 and above.
symbol: represents a unique identifier, created using the Symbol() function. It is only available in ECMAScript 2015 and above.
